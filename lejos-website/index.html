<p>
Like its predecessor (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyvm">TinyVM</a>),
leJOS is a tiny <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a><sup>TM</sup> runtime. It functions as a replacement firmware for the 
<a href="http://www.legomindstorms.com">Lego Mindstorms</a><sup>TM</sup> 
RCX microcontroller, which is part of Lego's Robotics Invention System (RIS).
The RCX contains a Hitachi H8300 processor and 32 Kb of RAM. 
We also have plans to port leJOS to other small devices.

<h3>TinyVM vs. leJOS</h3>

TinyVM is about 5 to 6 Kb smaller than leJOS in the RCX. The most important features
missing in TinyVM which are currently supported by leJOS are:

<ul>
<li>Floating point operations
<li>String constants
</ul>

Additionally, all references in the operand stack are marked as such.
This means that garbage collection can be implemented without much extra
effort. We are also writing several APIs consistent with this goal (e.g.
Vector and Hashtable). Other planned enhancements include: Multi-program
downloading, program arguments, auto power off, a fairly complete
<code>java.lang.Math</code> class, <code>java.io</code> APIs, 
<code>java.net</code> APIs, etc.

<h3>Downloading</h3>

There is no downloadable version of leJOS at this stage, but you can 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=9339">access
the CVS repository</a>. The module name is <code>lejos</code>.
If you are unfamiliar with CVS, visit the
<a href="http://sfdocs.sourceforge.net/sfdocs/">SourceForge Documentation Project</a>.
<p>
leJOS should work on any Unix system, including CygWin.
Do check the README
file for installation instructions. Consider the code pre-alpha and not very stable, as it's
constantly getting changed.
<p>
A first release is planned for late September or October 2000. 
<p>
The leJOS webpages are also on CVS. So you can not only contribute 
code, but also webpages and documentation. Please
contact us if you would like to become part of the leJOS team!
