TODO

* Plan for v1.2:
	- Create and test Site-Projekt
	- Make deployment target, for automnatically deployment to 
	  www.lejos.org/tools/eclipse/ldt
	- add LDT branding: Icons, docs, ...
		- Sort out the docs/internal into the new docs plugin TOC
		- write a user guide explaining the steps how to work with LDT
	- Run leJOS Program in Emulator
		- using a leJOS Emulator console for output
	- RunDelegate muss nicht nochmals linken


* Deployment
	- Differences in Eclipse when doing a plugin export via Wizard and via generated ANT file
	- ANT file for exporting will return immediately, but will run in background
		- parallel start not possible
		- but seems to be ready, very annoying
	- generated deploy.xml does not work from site project

* Other stuff:

	- newWizards: Ask Eclipse, how to change the classpath during new wizard,
	  and NOT at the end
	- contribute for leJOS Library Containers
	  for RCX and Client
	- make builder working only on deltas
	- signature file will be created for all binaries.
	  One would be enough, as it is always the same.
