Annotations:

- J2SDK 1.4.2_01 did not install correctly !
- Eclipse 3.0M3 did not work while 
  JavaPerspective -> Recfactor -> "Rename" a project (e.g. lejos)
  (does work with Eclipse 2.1.1)
  BTW: Eclipse 3.0 does NOT show, when creating .metadata, isnt it ?
- Eclipse 2.1.1: Creates a driectory: "C:\DOCUME~1\jhi\LOCALS~1\Temp\platform".
  Why ?



Ideas to extend the lejos-Plugin

1. Rename from lejos to org.lejos.plugins.eclipse

2. Linking output not to tmp file, use output folder instead
- Create signature file too. Use verbose option

3. Change menu structure
- Devices
      - leJOS
        - Link (.leJOS file to output folder)
	- =====
	- Run at RCX (if .java with main selected)
	- Run at Emulator (if .java with main selected)
		- Show results with console or other window
	- Show 
	- =====
	- Code Optimization
		- Show size of bytecode (Run Decompiler)
		- Show dependency structure
			(==> intelligent linking, can be taken into leJOS linker)
	- =====
	- Firmware download
	- =====
	- Options

4. Support the emulator too

5. Support leJOS 2.1 Java only tools

6. Decompile classes, to analyze size of bytecode
