Open Issues for leJOS plugin:


1. Functionality
- patch js.tools for creation of signature file
	- or clone functionality for the moment
- hierarchical link: write and check the tests

2. Development infrastructure
- Plugin folder structure
	- Why can an Eclipse plugin not use a directory structure like
		- src/java
		- src/test
	- Did not work for me !

3. Refactoring
- Use BCEL instead of js.tools classes, or extract the leJOS specific code
	==> Support of JDK 1.4 class file format too !!!

4. UI
- put leJOS in popupMenus after "Refresh"
- give toolbar good icons
