leJOS Eclipse plugin - design proposal

Version: 0.1 / 2003-10-20 / Jochen Hiller


Java Tools:

- I've inspected the code below js.tools, of 
  LejosDL, Download.
  Comments:
  	- In principle, the code can be used within Eclipse, 
  	  from my point of view running in the sam e VM as Eclipse.
  	- The design of "Download" is not as expected for a tool
  	  to be used from an external IDE
  	  	- Is static only class
  	  	- Uses a lot of System.out, System.err outputs
  	  	- Uses System.exit(), which would close the IDE
  	  	- The interface of Download is not sufficient, as for an IDE,
  	  	  the is no way to indicate progress, e.g. "xxx % downloaded"
- The same applies for Firmdl
- Open: How does the linker work ? I could see in CVS version a call to
  the platform binary file, and NOT using java Code only.
    JHI: ==> Update the CVS version into the workspace of the plugin

- General design decision:
	- Do we want to change the Download for the needs of the plugin ?
	- Do we want to "copy" the code, and do it directly witin the plugin ?

	- My proposal:
		- Refactor Download, that it can be used as standalone tool, within 
		  an IDE.
	- Disadvantage:
	    - This could break finishment of next leJOS version.
